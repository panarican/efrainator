3. Setting up a compass project
-------------------------------

You can create a compass project a few ways.

1. $ compass create <myproject>
2. clone this repo https://github.com/panarican/efrainator.git
3. You can also download my boilerplate template which I'm in the process of working on. I'll post it up once it's at a good place.

Feel free to change the config.rb file if the paths of your directories are different or if you want to change the way the css is outputted.

Once your project folder is in place along with the config settings run terminal and cd to your project folder, then run the following command.

$ compass watch
